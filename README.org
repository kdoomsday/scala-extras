* Description
This layer adds support for running scala code directly through =scala-cli=.

** Features:
  - Run scala scripts directly via =scala-cli=

The main functions to be aware of are ~scala-extras-execute~ and
~scala-extras-execute-directory~. Both also have ~-and-switch~ versions that
switch to the output buffer.

All modes depend on the variable ~scala-extras-output-buffer-name~, which is the
buffer name to use for output. The buffer will be created if it does not exist.

The first mode, ~scala-extras-execute~, runs the selected region (or full buffer
if no region) and sends the output to the output buffer. The second,
~scala-extras-execute-directory~, gets the directory of the active buffer and
sends that to scala-cli, to run as a project.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =scala-extras= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
